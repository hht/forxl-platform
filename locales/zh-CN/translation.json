Then, any remaining bonuses are distributed to the upline members involved in the promotion, according to a predetermined percentage. This cascading tier mechanism ensures that not only the direct contributors are rewarded, but also the upline members benefit from the overall performance of their team. This structure aims to encourage and reward teamwork and performance improvement, thereby driving overall business growth.",
        "In situations where an upline member and a downline member are at the same level, the upline member will receive 10% of the downline member's bonus earnings. If multiple members are at the same level, the level matching bonus is only awarded once."
